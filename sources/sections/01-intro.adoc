== Introduction

The schedulable object class defines a number of properties which are
required or useful for schedulable entities.

A schedulable entity may be scheduled for meetings (usually a person)
or for use (usually a resource).  The properties specified here allow
a client to discover such an entity and initiate a scheduling
request.

Some of the properties and values may be used by calendar servers to
determine the appropriate action when a scheduling request is
received.  For example, do we auto-accept the request if the entity
is available?
