=== Schedulable

A schedulable entity can be scheduled for meetings (as a person) or
for use (as a resource). For a scheduling system to be able to
usefully manage the schedule it needs specific information.

At the very least there MUST be some form of calendar user address.
It's useful to know whether requests can be auto accepted if the slot
is available.
